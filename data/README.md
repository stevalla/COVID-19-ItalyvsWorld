# Data

This folder contains all the data we process in our analysis.
In particular the history folder maintains a copy of all the data we
download each day, stored with the date of the last day present in each file.
The folder cleaned maintains the cleaned csvs used in the analysis. Every day
they are replaced by the new ones with the new downloaded data.
