# Grow rates

Here we plot the percentage grow rate of the number of confirmed and
deaths for each single country. Each plots starts from the
day of the first observation, until today.

The percentage grow rate is calculated as:

    ((confirmed[day] - confirmed[day - 1]) / confirmed[day - 1]) * 100
