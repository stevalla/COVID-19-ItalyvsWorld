# Analysis results

In this folder are stored all our analysis results. 

You can find:
- **logistic_curve.png:** Actual cumulative distribution of confirmed and
deaths in all the world.

- **italy_swabs_vs_confirmed.pdf:** For each region of Italy we plot, for each day,
the number of swabs performed vs the number of confirmed of that day. We also
plot a regression line to see how it fits. Every day a new plot is inserted at the
beginning of the file.

- **countries_distr:** Cumulative distributions of the number of confirmed
and deaths for each country in the dataset.

- **grow_rates:** Grow rates of the number of confirmed and deaths
for each country in the dataset.

- **histograms:** Histograms and kernel density estimation of the number
of confirmed and deaths for each country in the dataset.

- **logistic_curves:** Archives of old cumulative curve of confirmed
and deaths in all the world.

- **moving_average:** Distribution of increments in time
for each country. We also plot the moving average at 5 and 10 days to see
how well they fit the data.

- **geo:** Geographical plots to visualize the spread of the virus around the
world.
For more information about the results see the README inside each folder.
