# Moving average

Here we plot the daily increment as a bar plot. Then we calculate the 5-days, and
the 10-days exponential moving average to see how it fits the data. In this way
we can understand the stability of our data, so we can have an insight about
their reliability.

Furthermore, by comparing the 5-days ma with the 10-days ma we can see when
tha long estimates go over the short estimate. In fact, at the beginning,
we have just a few data, so the 5-ma is fitting better the distribution, even
because it grows very fast (even faster than exponentially in some cases), but
when we reach the flex of the curve, and the epidemic starts to slow down,
we can see that the 10-ma follows better the distribution.

The main reason of these results is obviously that we have more data,
and the data is related in time to more than 5 steps, probably even more than 10. 
So soon or later the 10-ma will fit better. In my opinion, this is not
the only view of these plots. In fact, if the states doesn't take measure against
the COVID, probably even with a lot of data, the 5-ma will fit better only
because the growth will be super-exponential as the research's estimates have
shown in these days. 

To conclude, let's hope that the 10-ma will be our best estimates in this scenario.
