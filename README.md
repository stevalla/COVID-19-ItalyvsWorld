# COVID-19 Italy and World

This repository has been created with the aim to perform some analysis with
the COVID-19 data of Italy and of the all world.

The data is updated daily from two repositories:
- World data: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
- Italy data: https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19
The data is updated daily, in the morning.

Our first intent is to practice on statistical analysis. We will focus firstly
on only COVID data, and then we would like to add others data that is likely
correlated with the virus, e.g. pollution and economic data.
